### What's up! My name's Kris - I'm a passionate self-taught Software Engineer based in Denver, CO

- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Entrepeneurship! Accessibility, solid UI/UX design, and developing applications that make an impact are my current priorities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the PostreSQL and full-stack development using Django! I'm furthering my experience in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immmersive Bootcamp and at over 80% completion of The Odin Project Foundations Path. 
- ⚒️ I'm currently building PomoTom, a productivity web app that utilizes the Pomodoro technique! I am the Product Manager on a team of 3 developers. We built PomoTom using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, custom CSS, and Material UI. Check it out here: [Logr](https://github.com/krismally/pomo-frontend)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack Web Dev projects with social impact (and/or startups)!
