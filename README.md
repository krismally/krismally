### What's up! My name's Kris - I'm a passionate self-taught Software Engineer based in Denver, CO

- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Entrepeneurship! Accessibility, solid UI/UX design, and developing applications that make an impact are my current priorities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the PostreSQL and full-stack development using Django! I'm furthering my experience in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immmersive Bootcamp and at over 80% completion of The Odin Project Foundations Path. 
- ⚒️ I'm currently refactoring Logr, a daily symptom tracker for people with chronic illnesses! I originally built Logr using the MEN (MongoDB, Express, Node) stack with EJS templates, custom CSS, and Bootstrap. I am refactoring the codebase to Python, Django, and PostgreSQL. Check it out here: [Logr](https://github.com/krismally/logr)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack Web Dev projects with social impact (and/or startups)!
